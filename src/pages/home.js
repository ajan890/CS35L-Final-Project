                    We came up with this idea totally on the fly since we needed something for our CS35L project but it
                    actually ended<br></br>
                    up sounding like a pretty great community connection project that would never work in real life due
                    to
                    the amount of<br></br>
                    trust each individual would have to have towards every other individual. But hey, that's what dreams
                    (and CS class<br></br>
                    projects) are for right. With the amount of walking around you have to do everyday, why not help a
                    fellow Bruin out<br></br>
                    by picking up a couple of things along the way? Since you're still reading, here's a picture of a
                    laptop
                    and some<br></br>
                    coffee I found off of google Looks nice, doesn't it? Just like this webpage, I'm sure. #UAW STRIKE
